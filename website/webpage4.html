       <br>Multiple cropping is a form of Ecological Intensification (harvesting) that is potentially highly sustainable when two or more crops are grown at the same time or in a sequence.

      <br> It does this by balancing three key ecological processes: competition, on the one hand, and commensalism (one plant gaining benefits from the other) or mutualism (both plants benefitting each other) on the other.
     <br> Typically, farmers will plant crops as close together as possible to utilize all the available land. When different crop species or varieties are grown together, the competition may be fierce; â€Žtrees grown in a maize field, for example, may shade out the crop. But this can be compensated for by determining the optimal spacing and by exploiting various forms of commensalism or mutualism, for example where the tree may be a legume,
       providing nitrogen for the crop plant beneath.
