    <p>The expected outcomes of our DTL project are as follows:

       <br> 1)Create a self sustained agricultural model which can address the various agricultural problems with respect to resource utilization, cost optimization and real time monitoring.
        <br>2)Create a probabilistic model based on five year data collection zonally and create a recommender system for the farmers to improve their yield in worst case scenarios.
        <br>3)Improve the concept of crop rotation and multi cropping through our prototype as we found this to be the problem faced by the farmers via surveying them.
        <br>4)Making agricultural IOT cost effective by reducing the cost on the hardware components(Using NODE MCU  instead of Rasperry PI which is 10 times cheaper)  and to have a centralized approach for monitoring gross field monitoring.
        <br>5)Making this platform as simple and reachable to the rural farmers who are not so used to technology.
