        How You Can Do Multiple Cropping?<br>
        There are different forms and types of multiple cropping.<br>
        
        Intercropping: Intercropping means interspersion of different crops on the same piece of land, such as a home garden, either at random or more commonly in 
        alternate rows usually designed to minimize competition but maximize the potential for both crops to make use of the available nutrients, such as nitrogen supplied by a legume.
        <br>
        Rotations: the growing of two or more crops in sequence on the same piece of land.
        <br>
        Agroforestry: Annual herbaceous crops are grown interspersed with perennial trees or shrubs. The deeper-rooted trees can often exploit water and nutrients otherwise unavailable to the crops. The trees may also provide shade and mulch, creating a microenvironment, whilst the ground cover of crops reduces weeds and prevents erosion.
        <br>
        Green Manuring: the growing of legumes and other plants to fix nitrogen and then incorporate the nutrients into the soil for the following crop. Commonly used green manures are Sesbania and the fern Azolla, which contains nitrogen-fixing, blue-green algae in rice fields.
