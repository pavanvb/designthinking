	<p>The expected outcomes of our DTL project are as follows:
		<br>1)Create a self sustained agricultural model which can address the various agricultural problems with respect to resourses to resourse utilization ,cost optimization and real time monitoring.
		<br>2)Create a probabilistic model based on 5 year data collection zonally and create a recommender system for the farmers to improve their yield in worst case scenarios.
		<br>3)Improve the concept of crop rotation and multicropping through our prototype as we found this to be the problem faced by the farmers via surveying them.
		<br>4)Making agricultural IOT cost effective by reducing the cost on the hardware components(USING NODE MCU instead rasperry pi which is 10 times cheaper)and have a centralized approach for monitoring gross field monitoring.
		<br>5)Making this platform as simple and reachable to the rural farmers who are not so used to technology.
